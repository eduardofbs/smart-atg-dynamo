# smart-atg-dynamo

Work in progress...

This is a Chrome extension to improve Oracle ATG Dynamo usability. For now it can do:
* Buttons to pre-create XML print-item and query-items in item-descriptor list
* Print-item XML syntax highlight
* Automatic scroll to XML after request
* Sort item descriptors
* Create a print item when XML item-descriptor name is clicked (you should change the item-descriptor sometimes)

You can download this repository and add it to Chrome going to extensions, activating 'Developer Mode' and using 'Load Unpacked Extension'. Or download it from Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-atg-dynamo/apdodcbnnfkiohphgedncobeejeccjbk
